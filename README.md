# Estimativa
MomMania

Estimativa is a card game that requires players to estimate the number of rounds they will win, based on the cards they are dealt. The game is played with a standard deck of cards, and each card has a weight based on its suit and number, with Aces being the highest-ranking card. The order of the suits, from highest to lowest, is: Gold, Sword, Cups and Clubs.

The objective of the game is to estimate the number of rounds you will win. Each round, the number of cards dealt to each player increases, starting with one card per player in the first round and increasing until it reaches the maximum number of cards. For example, if there are five players, the number of cards dealt per round will increase from one to ten, and then decrease back to one again.

An important rule to keep in mind is that all players must play the same suit as the first card played, unless they do not have that suit, in which case they can play any card they choose.

If a player correctly estimates the number of rounds they will win, they double the number of points they earn for winning those rounds. If they overestimate or underestimate the number of rounds they will win, they lose the difference between their estimate and the actual number of rounds they won. If a player estimates that they will win zero rounds and then wins zero rounds, they earn one point.

This adds an additional layer of strategy to the game, as players must not only think about their chances of winning individual rounds, but also their overall performance and how many rounds they think they will win.

In the last round, when each player receives one card, they are not allowed to look at their own card, they can only see the cards of their opponents, which can make this round more exciting and challenging. This adds an element of surprise and can make the last round more unpredictable, which can lead to more intense gameplay and more opportunities for players to make last-minute adjustments to their estimates and strategies.

Examples of strategies players can use include paying attention to the cards they have been dealt and the cards their opponents have played, as well as keeping track of the number of rounds remaining and adjusting their estimates accordingly. Another strategy would be to keep track of the cards that have been played in order to get an idea of the remaining cards in the deck, which can help inform estimates and card-playing decisions.

In summary, Estimativa is a fun and exciting game that requires players to use strategy, estimation and quick thinking to win. Players must carefully manage their cards and make accurate estimates to come out on top. The game is filled with twists and turns and can be enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels.

# Example

Here is an example of how the game can unfold. Let's suppose we are playing with 4 players: John, Mary, Charles, and Daniel.

1st Round: John plays the first card, a sword of value 8. Mary, Charles, and Daniel also play swords, Mary playing the value 3, Charles playing the value 5, and Daniel playing the value 10. Since Daniel played the most valuable card, he wins the round.

2nd Round: Mary plays the first card, a gold of value 2. John, Charles, and Daniel also play gold, John playing the value 4, Charles playing the value 1, and Daniel playing the value 7. Since John played the most valuable card, he wins the round.

3rd Round: Charles plays the first card, a cup of value 6. John, Mary, and Daniel also play cups, John playing the value 9, Mary playing the value 3, and Daniel playing the value 1. Since John played the most valuable card, he wins the round.

And so on, until the players run out of cards or until a player reaches the estimated number of wins. As you can see, players need to think not only about the value of the cards but also the suit and the right moment to play their cards to maximize their chances of winning the round.
